                        was up to in my former life:

                        <p>
                            The Ellman lab had developed a cobalt-based catalyst 
                            designed to catalyze the sequential addition of two electrophilic 
                            coupling partners to a molecule's activated C-H bond. 
                            I expanded the scope of use for this catalyst, demonstrating
                            its ability to stereoseletively catalyze the addition of
                            dienes and aldehydes to benzamides. Three-component products 
                            from this catalyst's reactions provide straightforward 
                            access to desirable bioactive molecular 
                            structures, simplifing drug product synthesis.

                            Computational prediction of phosphoramidate prodrug binding to Hint1
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Phosphoramidate caging is a strategy for sneaking
                            phosphate-containing drugs across the cell membrane, 
                            increasing their permeability by neutralizing their negative charge. 
                            Once in cells, these caging groups are removed by a 
                            phosphoramidase that exists within the cell. Based on Hint1’s 
                            known phosphoramidase behavior on nucleotide substrates, 
                            we suspected it may be able to uncage other phosphoramidate-caged
                            molecules. Using molecular docking, I provided computational 
                            predictions and associated statistical analysis describing the 
                            likely binding of a phosphoramidate-caged Pin1 inhibitor 
                            to the active site of Hint1, suggesting a mechanism for 
                            the uncaging and free inhibitor release we observed in cells. 
                            This work indicates an expanded substrate scope for Hint1, 
                            suggesting that the phosphoramidate prodrugging strategy 
                            can be used to increase the cell permeability of molecules 
                            other than the historical nucleotide-based drugs for which 
                            the strategy was designed.

                            Determining peptide structural requirements to activate the 20S proteasome
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The proteasome is responsible for breaking down unneeded cellular proteins
                            so that their component amino acids can be reused. It is activated
                            in cells by partner proteins that stick their C termini into
                            pockets on the proteasome surface. Peptides as short as 
                            six amino acids, containing the binding “HbYX” 
                            (hydrophobic-Tyrosine-any C terminus) motif, are capable of
                            mimicking that behavior of activating the proteasome.  
                            As part of a broader investigation into the relationship
                            between these peptides' structure and their activity, 
                            we synthesized and tested a peptide panel to better
                            understand the requirements for proteasome activation
                            by peptides. This study contributes to a structural understanding
                            allostery in the proteasomal degradation pathway.
